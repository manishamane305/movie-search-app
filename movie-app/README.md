Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

About the Movie Website Project
Welcome, to the best movie website using react js. 

We will see how to call an API, and how to display API data using the map on our page, they will use the context API and useContext hook to store the data and then pass it to the children who need it.

We have a search input form too, where users can search any movie name, and based on that query we show them the results the best part is we use debounce on our website, which helps API to hit once only when it is required to know more about the debounce.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
